# Signet Witness

**The business record AI can't fake.**

CC `sealed@witnessed.cc` on your business emails. Signet verifies the DKIM
signature, records who you emailed and when, and discards everything else.

Live at **[witnessed.cc](https://witnessed.cc)**

---

## What this is

A Next.js app that:

1. Receives emails via a Cloudflare Worker → `/api/inbound`
2. Verifies the DKIM signature with `mailauth`
3. Records the sender domain, receiver domain, and timestamp in Postgres
4. Serves a public seal page at `/b/[domain]`

No auth. No payments. No setup required from users. The CC is the product.

## Local setup

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/turnstile-labs/signet-witness
cd signet-witness
npm install

# 2. Copy env
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in DATABASE_URL (or STORAGE_URL) and INBOUND_SECRET

# 3. Create tables
psql $DATABASE_URL -f schema.sql
# or paste schema.sql into the Vercel Postgres dashboard query runner

# 4. Run locally
npm run dev
```

---

## Deploy

### Next.js app (Vercel)

```bash
# Push to GitHub, import in Vercel dashboard
# Add Postgres store: Vercel dashboard → Storage → Connect → Postgres
# Add env var INBOUND_SECRET in project settings
```

### Cloudflare Worker

```bash
cd workers/email-router
npm install

# Set secrets
wrangler secret put INBOUND_URL     # https://witnessed.cc/api/inbound
wrangler secret put INBOUND_SECRET  # must match Vercel env var

# Deploy
wrangler deploy
```

### Cloudflare Email Routing

In your Cloudflare dashboard for `witnessed.cc`:

1. Enable **Email Routing**
2. Add a catch-all rule: `*@witnessed.cc` → **Send to Worker** → `signet-email-router`

---

## Database schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS domains (
  id          SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  domain      TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  first_seen  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  event_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  tier        TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'free',
  updated_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS events (
  id               SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  domain_id        INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES domains(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  receiver_domain  TEXT NOT NULL,
  dkim_hash        TEXT NOT NULL,
  witnessed_at     TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## How DKIM verification works

Every email carries a `DKIM-Signature` header — a cryptographic signature
from the sender's mail server. The corresponding public key is published in
the sender's DNS. `mailauth` fetches that DNS record and verifies the
signature automatically.

If verification fails, the event is silently discarded. Only DKIM-passing
emails build history. History built this way cannot be backdated or forged.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` or `STORAGE_URL` | Neon Postgres connection string |
| `INBOUND_SECRET` | Shared secret between Cloudflare Worker and `/api/inbound` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | `https://witnessed.cc` (used for metadata) |

---

## Privacy

| What | Status |
|---|---|
| Sender domain | Stored |
| Receiver domain | Stored |
| Timestamp | Stored |
| DKIM signature hash | Stored |
| Email body | Discarded immediately — never touches disk |
| Subject line | Discarded immediately |
| Attachments | Discarded immediately |
| Personal content | Never stored, never read |

The CC is an explicit, voluntary act on each individual email.
